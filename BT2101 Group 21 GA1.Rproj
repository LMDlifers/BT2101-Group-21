# b linear model

summary(model)

"The linear model generated a coefficient of 0.06493 for prpblck, 
with a p-value of 0.00702, which is statistically significant at the 99% confidence level. 
This suggests that the relationship between prpblck and psoda is unlikely to be due to random chance, 
indicating a meaningful association between the two variables. 
Specifically, for every 1-unit increase in the proportion of the black population (prpblck), 
the price of soda (psoda) increases by approximately $0.06493.Thus, prpblck is
worth evaluating further."


# c) 

"While this relationship is statistically significant,
the model does not account for potential confounding factors, selection bias, 
potential reverse causality nor establish a direct causal mechanism. Hence, we are unable unable to make 
a causal claims with a high degree of confidence with the current model as the
current threats to the experiment's internal validity can produce biased estimates
that can lead to a misrepresentation of the true effects of prpblck on psoda.
"

# d)

"The following variables could be potential omitted confounders:"

"
Income Levels (income):

Rationale: Higher income areas might have higher prices due to greater purchasing power, 
independent of racial demographics. If prpblck is correlated with lower income levels, 
this could confound the observed relationship between prpblck and psoda.
"

"
Poverty Levels (prppov):

Rationale: Poverty levels could affect both the pricing of products 
(due to economic conditions in poorer neighborhoods) and 
the racial composition of an area. Higher poverty rates might 
lead to lower prices if stores adjust prices to cater to 
local economic conditions. 
Failure to control for poverty could lead to omitted variable bias.
"

"
Population Density (density):

Rationale: Urban areas with higher population density often have 
higher prices due to increased demand and competition. 
If urban areas also have higher proportions of black residents, 
population density could confound the relationship.
"

"
Crime Rate (crmrte):

Rationale: Areas with higher crime rates might face higher operating costs 
for businesses, which could lead to higher prices. If these areas 
also have a higher proportion of black residents, 
crime rates could be a confounder.
"


" Housing Values (hseval):

Rationale: The cost of living, including housing prices, 
often reflects the economic conditions of an area. 
Higher housing values might lead to higher overall prices for goods, 
including soda. Housing values could be correlated with both 
racial demographics and soda prices, making it an important confounder.
"

"
Cultural factors:
Cultural factors such as community norms can influence both the pricing strategies
and the racial composition of an area"

"
Store-specific policies:
Stores may set different prices based on qualitative and subjective factors.
"

# e)

"
All forementioned variables; income, prppov, density, crmrte, hseval can measured
and are available in the dataset.

However, cultural factors and store-specific policies are not available in the datset,
due to their nature of being challenging to quantify into a dataset.

Potential proxies for these factors can include using ethnic diversity 
or language being spoken at home and identifying the type of chain such 
as company-owned vs franchies which offers more 
insights on how pricing strategies are applied at more domestic level.These variables
are then evaluated in binaries (e.g 1 or 0).

# f)

model2 <- lm(psoda ~ prpblck + income + prppov + density + crmrte + hseval + prpncar + chain, data = discrim)


# lm model
# prpblck coeff 0.06493
# R^2 = 0.0108
# Adj R^2 = 0.01561

summary(model)

# lm model2
# prpblck coeff 1.092e-01
# R^2 = 0.2076
# Adj R^2 = 0.1914

summary(model2)


# Change in prpblck coeff

"
The coefficient for prpblck has increased from 0.06493 to 0.1092, 
which means that after controlling for confounding variables, 
the effect of the proportion of the black population on soda prices has become stronger. 
This suggests that once other factors (like income, poverty levels, and housing values) 
are taken into account, 
the relationship between prpblck and psoda becomes more pronounced.
Furthermore, the p-value has also decrease, making the R/S even more statistically
significant.
"

# Change in R^2 and Adj R^2

"
The R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values have increased substantially in model2 
(from 0.01808 to 0.2076 for Multiple R-squared, and from 0.01561 to 0.1914 for Adjusted R-squared). 
This indicates that the new model with the additional confounding variables 
explains a much larger proportion of the variance in soda prices. 
In other words, this model fits the data much better.
"

# Overall new interpretation

"
After controlling for the forementioned confounders, prpblck has a strong
and statistically significant positive effect on soda prices. Specifically, for 
every one unit increase in prpblck, soda prices increase by approx $0.1092 in 
contrast to the previous model's of $0.06493. Even after accounting for all the
the previously omitted confounders, prpblck still has a significant impact on psoda.
All in all, including the omitted confounders improved the model's explanatory 
power, indicating that these factors are imperative to understand how soda 
prices are set.
